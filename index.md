## Summary

Researcher and data analyst with a strong background in biosciences, currently working as a Research Officer at Humankind Charity, where I focus on predictive modelling of health outcomes and evaluating nature-based treatment programmes. Skilled in managing large datasets, time series analysis, and advanced statistical methods using Python and R. Developed pipelines combining NLP with human-in-the-loop thematic analysis to derive insights from complex data, such as case notes and interview transcripts, while adhering to Aqua Book guidelines and ensuring GDPR compliance. As the first Research Officer for Humankind (South West), I implemented ONS GitHub tools to create a robust, reproducible coding environment. Experienced in conducting and publishing research, and passionate about applying qualitative insights to inform evidence-based policies and enhance organisational outcomes.
